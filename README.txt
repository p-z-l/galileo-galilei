What is this?
=======================
This is a web project that I made few years ago in my high school. My history teacher asked us to do a reasearch project about Renaissance, while my classmates are making some silly posters and videos, I came up with the idea of making a website.
DO USE THIS PROJECT AS A TUTORIAL, it's a terible example of how to make a website. I keep this repo on GitHub only as a memento.

At the time I was making this website, I only have a limited knowledge about HTML and CSS, and no experience with JavaScript at all, that's why the code in this project is so terrible. Also, I made quite a bit of grammer mistakes throughout the website, I was not very good at English back then (English is not my first language).

Copyright & License
=======================
This project is not licensed, I give up all the copyright protections for this project.
Also, I have no idea how to do citations back then, so there's is definitely some copyright problems involved.
